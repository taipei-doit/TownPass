The `src/assets` directory is typically used for storing static assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets. Since you requested to generate the contents of the `assets` folder but did not specify any particular files or assets to include, I will leave this directory intentionally blank.

Here is the content for the file:

/foodsafety-site/src/assets
<!-- This directory is intentionally left blank. -->
